How to use:
1. Insert eye joints and eye materials into their respective slots on the script in Unity 
2. Adjust sensitivity and offset until it matches the bone rotation
3. (Optional) Invert axis if the eyes are moving in the opposite direction than intended (moving eye up and down causing the material to scroll on x axis and vice versa)
